# game_of_sticks


Repository Name = sticks

Dana Walker & Will Warren

files:

1. README.md, this files
2. sticks.py
  - a fully functional game of sticks with a fully functional AI
  - run via terminal/shell "python3 sticks.py" from its directory
3. sticks_test.py
  - a test suite for sticks
  - all tests pass, though admittedly, the game could be written better
 (ahem...refactored) to have more testable code
 4. ai.py
  - our AI class
5. game.py
  - our game class
6. player.py
 - our player class

 YOU DO NOT NEED TO DL ai.py, game.py, or player.py to run the program. All of the classes are contained in the final submitted sticks.py file. :)

 Notes/Observations
 - This would be much easier to read if it were refactored a few times. but
 alas... deadlines
 - We are kicking ourselves for not writing the tests first
 - Refactoring..yay
